We are very happy to introduce a new release of TAPAAL 2.4.1 that contains some bug fixes, namely:

 - a problem with loading verifyta.exe file (UPPAAL engine) on some windows installations running Java 6,
 - a bug in simulator when used with urgent transitions,
 - corrects the interpretation of verification results as some are actually valid also for the continuous semantics, and
 - propertly terminates processes run via the batch processing dialog.
