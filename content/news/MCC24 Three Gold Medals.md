We are very happy to announce that at this year Model Checking Contest, our tool TAPAAL defended the gold medal in the CTL category and more over took back two additional gold medals in the LTL category as well as the most prestigius reachability category.
Moreover, we also won two silver medals in upper-bounds and in global properties. We thank to all developers who contributed to the success of our tool at this year competition. The detailed results can be found here:
