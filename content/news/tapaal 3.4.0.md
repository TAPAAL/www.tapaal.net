We are happy to announce the release of TAPAAL 3.4.0 with improved engines for the discrete-time verification (verifydtapn) and the untimed engine (verifypn). It also includes a GUI support for using partial order reduction for the discrete-time engine. The summary of features are:


- Partial order reduction to the verifydtapn engine.
- Support for timed-safety-games to the engine (no GUI support yet).
- Refactoring of verifydtapn engine and all around for performance improvement
  (including new successor generator).
- Numerous improvements for the untimed verifypn engine (including
  structural reductions for CTL and advanced query simplification algorithms).
