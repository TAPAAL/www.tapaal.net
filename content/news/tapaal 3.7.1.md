We are happy to announce the release of TAPAAL 3.7.1 that contains larger refactoring and new features, in particular:

  * GUI and engine support for Petri net games (untimed and dicrete time),
  * the possibility to explicitly edit timed/untimed and game/non-game nets,
  * updated verifypn (untimed) engine,
  * quick drawing of nets when holding ctrl while in arc-drawing mode,
  * large refactoring and bug fixes in the GUI.
