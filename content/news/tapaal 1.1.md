A new release of TAPAAL 1.1 is now available at the download page.

This release fixes a number of bugs and introduces two new features:

boundedness checking and
visualization of untimed traces for the verification of liveness properties.
Finally, a few demo examples are now included in the distribution. In particular, new users might want to open and experiment with the self-explanatory example [intro-example.xml](http://tapaal.net/fileadmin/download/tapaal-1.1/intro-example_01.xml).
