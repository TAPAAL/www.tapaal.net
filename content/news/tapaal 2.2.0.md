TAPAAL 2.2.0 is a major upgrade of the tool featuring a new open source engine for closed timed-arc Petri nets. The main new features are:

 - new TAPAAL engine called verifydtapn for discrete verification of closed nets
 - updated TAPAAL engine verifytapn
 - transition statistics that shows how many times transitions were enabled during the search
 - support for weighted arcs in the editor, simulator and the new engine
 - fully adjustable workspace that can be saved in preferences
 - new shortcuts, namely the arrows that can be used both in editor and simulator (e.g. in editor arrows left/right can increase/decrease constant values when highlighted and ctrl-M runs the  - verification of the currently selected query)
 - number of other GUI improvements and bug-fixes.

This update is highly recommended to all TAPAAL users.
