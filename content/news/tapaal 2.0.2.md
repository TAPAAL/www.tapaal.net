We are announcing the release of the following TAPAAL updates:

 - TAPAAL 2.0.2

TAPAAL 2.0.2 is a maintenance release that fixes a number of bugs, one of them connected to slow verification in case of the presence of orphan transitions (no input and no output arcs) and it fixes some rare issues during the saving of a net. The release also improves the layout of the query dialog and several other dialogs and a new example of train level crossing has been added to File/Example net.

This is a highly recommended update for all users of 2.0.1.
