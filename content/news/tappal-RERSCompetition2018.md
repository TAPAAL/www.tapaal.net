This year, we participated for the first time in CTL model checking competition RERS and we are happy to announce that we solved all problems proposed by the competition and rank as the most successful tool in this category (though there were no medals in this category as it was an experimental run this year). More details are available (here)[http://rers-challenge.org/2018/index.php?page=results].
