We are glad to announce the release of TAPAAL 3.4.1 that fixes some bugs in the previous release, most notably it addresses the issues with

  - launching TAPAAL GUI on Mac Os X with Java 9,
  - conversion of Reachability to CTL queires in the query creation dialog,
  - fixes in evaluating arithmetical expressions and nested deadlock queries in the untimed verifypn engine for P/T nets.

This is a highly recommended update to all TAPAAL users.
