We are happy to announce a new release of TAPAAL 1.4 that adds new features like

 - timed inhibitor arcs,
 - completely new query creation dialog,
 - option to model and verify untimed Petri nets (mainly for educational purposes),
 - several visual improvements,
 - bug fixes and
 - it deals with the new licensing policy of UPPAAL.

The release also contains an improved example of Alternating Bit Protocol that shows the power of transport arcs that allow to time-stamp tokens travelling in the net.
