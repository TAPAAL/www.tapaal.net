# User Documentation
For new users starting with TAPAAL, we recommend to run TAPAAL and open the following net [intro-example.tapn](http://download.tapaal.net/fileadmin/download/resources/intro-example.tapn) (the net can be open from files - Examples Nets - intro-example) which will explain the main modeling features and verification possibilites. After that you are welcome to solve the following [TAPAAL exercises](http://download.tapaal.net/fileadmin/download/resources/tapaal-exercises.pdf).
		
## User Manual
We currently do not have an up-to-date user manual and are in the progress of creating a new documentation website. If you have the time and/or energy, we are happy to accept contributions to your new online documentation site. 

* [docs.tapaal.net](https://docs.tapaal.net) (Work-in-progress)

Until the new site is ready you might also find these resources helpful: 

* [old manual](https://github.com/TAPAAL/tapaalusermanual/tree/master/manuscript) (Pre TAPAAL v 2.0)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
You can find a list of FAQ on our launchpad page:

 * [TAPAAL FAQ](https://answers.launchpad.net/tapaal/+faqs)
 
If you have any other problems, please ask on [launchpad answers](https://answers.launchpad.net/tapaal) where both users and the development team will answer questions. You are also welcome to contact the development team directly on email: [tapaal(at)cs.aau.dk](mailto:tapaal@cs.aau.dk)
